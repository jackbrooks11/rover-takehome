# Rover Take-home Project

## Description

The Rover Take-home Project is an effort to rebuild the search ranking algorithm for Rover.com, a dog sitting service platform that was compromised in an unfortunate accident. Our goal is to recreate the search scores for sitters using data retrieved from the Google search index. This project involves developing a simple command-line program to process, calculate, and output search rankings in CSV format based on specified criteria.
